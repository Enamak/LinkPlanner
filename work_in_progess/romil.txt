  - define the experimental setup (components to buy)

2017-10-09
TO BE DONE
- make clear the goal of your work: to apply the Stokes PolDemux algorithm to a KK receiver
- Improve the text (theory)
- Start to write a simulation section
- Start to write a experimental section

Next meeting: 2017-10-17, 2 pm

2017-10-02
TO BE DONEI
Next meeting 
- What are the requirements for the KK receiver? (Minimum Phase Signal and Analytical Signal)
- What is the definition (Minimum Phase Signal and Analytical Signal)?
- How we can use these signals and profit from?

Later
Hilbert Transform
How to generate?


2017-09-14
TO BE DONE
- study two papers (Mecozzi16, Mecozzi17)
- write in our own words the system setup (explain)
- reproduce the results in NetXPTO - LinkPlanner
